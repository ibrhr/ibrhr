### Hi, I'm Ibrahim ðŸ‘‹

A Software Engineer, I specialize in Machine Learning and Deep Learning, with a portfolio of hands-on projects ranging from AI Agents, Object Detection Models, to probabilistic machine learning approaches for solving real-world problems.

My work utilizes technical depth with practical execution. I focus on building things that work, fast and reliably. From data visualization notebooks that tell stories, to models trained with rigorous experimentation and a researcher's mindset.

I'm currently diving deeper into NLP, LLMs, Generative AI, Agentic AI, and probablistsic learning. Whether it's deploying tools to the cloud, tuning models for real-world performance, or simply telling a clean, compelling story with data, I'm all in.

Feel free to reach out or collaborate.
