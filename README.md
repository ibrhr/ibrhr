### About Me

### Hi, I'm Ibrahim ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineer, navigating extreme challenges while pushing the boundaries of what's possible with code. I specialize in Machine Learning and Deep Learning, with a growing portfolio of hands-on projectsâ€”from custom object detectors, transfer learning pipelines, and intelligent agents, to probabilistic machine learning approaches for solving real-world problems.

My work blends technical depth with practical execution. I focus on building things that work, work fast, and work for peopleâ€”from data visualization notebooks that tell powerful stories, to models trained with rigorous experimentation and a researcher's mindset.

I'm currently diving deeper into computer vision, data analysis, and probablistsic learning. Whether it's deploying tools to the cloud, tuning models for real-world performance, or simply telling a clean, compelling story with dataâ€”I'm all in.

ðŸ“« Feel free to reach out or collaborate. Every line of code is a step toward something bigger.
